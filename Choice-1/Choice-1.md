## Tale of an anxious Jake

No matter how anxious he is, his ego tells him that he has to watch the movie to prove that nothing scares him and that he is very brave, so he proceeds to play the movie.

The next day upon waking up, he gets ready to go study. As he walks to his school, he feels like someone is following him. Jake has two ideas:


[Confront the person who was following him](Choice-1.2.md)


[Run away, going back home](Choice-1.3.md)
