No matter how anxious he is, his ego tells him that he has to watch the movie to prove that nothing scares him and that he is very brave, so he proceeds to play the movie.

The next day upon waking up, he gets ready to go study. As he walks to his school, he feels like someone is following him. Jake has an idea, he turns around and asks, agitated, why is he following him. 
Before he can speak, as he turns around, the guy jump over him and fatally stabs him with a knife. Before losing consciousness, Jake notices that the suspect is wearing the same mask as the character from the horror movie he watched the night before.

He dies.
